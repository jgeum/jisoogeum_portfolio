        <p>I was part of the initial stages of the redesign project. As the design lead, I presented a redesign idea of the current mobile app based on the insights from the competitor analysis and further user research. Due to time constraints, I narrowed the UX research methods into three.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top:150px;">User Research</h4>
        <p>I was able to recruit 4 interview participants. 2 of them were foreign workers in Korea while the others were Korean students studying in the United States. After synthesizing data from app reviews and user interviews, we identified a central issue that's been causing various customer complaints across the app. We also discovered an interesting aspect about the Sentbe app that can increase customer retnetion and acquisition.</p>
        
        <h4 style="margin-top:150px;">Discovery 1</h4>
        <h1>Users claimed that the transfer never went through or that the remittance process is slower than advertised.</h1> </br>
        <p>In order to understand the cause of this problem, we have to look at how the original <b>Transfer Request Process</b> is designed:</p> </br>
        <a href="../Assets/img_sentbe/Transfer Process.png" data-lightbox="persona"><img src="../Assets/img_sentbe/Transfer Process.png" class="img-fluid lightbox-hover"></a>

          <div class="col-xl-6 align-self-start mr-2">
            <p>As shown in the image, it is crucial that users deposit the entered amount to the Virtual Wallet in order to begin the international transfer process. <em class="blue-em">The reason why Sentbe cannot directly transfer money from users' local bank account is because this method interferes with the Korean international remittance law.</em></p>
          </div> <!-- Div Right Ends -->
          <!-- Div Left -->
          <div class="col-xl-6 align-self-start">
            <p>From the user tests we conducted, we realized that <em class="blue-em">the users often forget to complete the 4th step.</em></br> When we asked them to try requesting a transfer, two of them stopped at the 3rd step and expected the transfer process to begin. This is because the users were already expecting the app to automatically deposit the entered amount from their local bank account since they've already provided their account number in the on-boarding process. </br> <em class="blue-em">In our redesign, we decided to explore different ways to remind the users about the Virtual Wallet.</em></p>

        <h4 style="margin-top:150px;">Discovery 2</h4>

            <p>According to users, the main factor that makes Sentbe stand out from the other mega-corporate services (i.e., Kakao Pay) is the low price and promotional events. </br>However, as shown in the image, information about the promotional events are only shown in the See More page, which is the last page users will try to see when they open the app.</br> In our redesign, <em class="blue-em">we decided to explore ways to emphasize this promotion banner.</em></p>

           <div class="col-10 col-sm-8 col-lg-6">
            <p>There is a very simple way to solve this problem, such as adding a reminder on the confirmation page. Though this solution was well-received, our design manager wanted us to go above an beyond the current design system and present a complete re-design of the app.</p>
            <a href="../Assets/img_sentbe/newSolution1.png" data-lightbox="solution-sentbe"><img src="../Assets/img_sentbe/newSolution1.png" class="img-fluid lightbox-hover"></a>

          <!-- Div Right -->
           <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>Thus, we also presented a re-imagined version of the solution that includes a new home page. This design better establishes the concept of a Virtual Wallet to the users' mental model. Through the home page, users will easily remember to charge the Virtual Wallet before requesting a transfer. If the user forgot to charge their Virtual Wallet, the wallet itself can remind the users.</p>

            <p><b>How can we utilize the promotional banners better?</b></p>

            <p><b>How can we alleviate users' concerns when the transfer process is taking too long?</b></p>
            <p>As previously mentioned, many existing users expressed complaints about the slow transfer process. Since we cannot change the speed of the process, we used design to help mitigate this frustration.</p>

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>Because my internship ended ealier than the others, I had to present the current solutions to the product team. The other teammates will continue to conduct more research and refine the designs for the remainder of their internship. </br>When I presented our solutions to the product team, the members were very intrigued by the idea of a home page. The overall reaction was that this can be useful when they release new features. However, implementing the home page indeed requires more time than the other solutions so this idea was tabled for now. </br>The silverlining was that the other ideas were very well-received!</p>

        <h4 class="white-text mt-5">Project 3: Promotional Website</h4>
        <p class="white-text mt-4">This project was also a quick design sprint. The marketing team wanted to create a short and concise promotional webpage. This webpage will be shown when potential users click on an advertisement.</p>

        <h4 class="white-text mt-5">My Role</h4>
        <p class="white-text mt-4">One of my major (unexpected) roles in this project was UX writing. Initially, the marketing team wanted us to use the same copy as the one from the main website. However, I realized that majority of our users are non-native English or Korean speakers as most of them come from South East Asia. Since the original copy included phrases that are rather unclear, I suggested that we use a different copy that is more straightforward and easy-to-understand. </br></br>
          The image below shows the original copy from the main website.</p>

        <img src="../Assets/img_sentbe/originalbanner.png" alt="Original Banner" class="img-fluid">
        <p class="white-text mt-4">Below is part of the copy I suggested to use for the promotional webpage. After a discussion, we decided to move forward with this copy. </p>

          <li>Ask as many questions to other teams, such as technical constraints and business constraints!</li>
          <li>Communication is key. Be articulate and clear when explaining designs to other teams.</li>
          <li>Don't be afraid to speak up and express opinions. Often times, the ideas and opinions will be cherished. Even if my solution isn't well-received, there is always something to learn from!</li>
